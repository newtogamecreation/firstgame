# firstgame
This is first game in python called random circles. This draws random cicles on the screen.
The game displays cirlces of random colors on the screen and displays the kyes associated with the color.
These are the colors of the circle -BLUE, RED, WHITE, GREEN, YELLOW, GRAY, STEELBLUE and these are the keys for them. b, r, w, g, y, a, s.
Since this is my first game that I developed I am not sure, I would be very thankful if you can provide my feedback,bugs, suggestions
