This draws random circles on the screen. The game displays circles of random colors on the screen and displays the keys associated with the color. These are the colors of the circle -BLUE, RED, WHITE, GREEN, YELLOW, GRAY, STEELBLUE and these are the keys for them. b, r, w, g, y, a, s. Since this is my first game that I developed I am not sure, I would be very thankful if you can provide my feedback,bugs, suggestions to this email.new_to_gamecreation[at]outlook[dot]com
